    <td> IFB102 - Introduction to Computer Systems </td>
    <td> 
      <blockquote>
      This is an introductory computer science unit concerning computer systems, in particular how modern computer systems work, how they are structured,
      and how they operate. Computer systems are ubiquitous and yet they are unlike any other man-made product or system; they appear magical and are
      notoriously difficult to work with and manage in projects. This unitâ€™s goal is to demystify computer systems so students can appreciate, understand
      and utilise computer systems in their subsequent learning, and effectively participate in the IT industry. Students will study computers, networks,
      operating systems and the Web. Raspberry Pi computers will be used throughout the unit and at the end students will build their own small computer
      system using a Raspberry Pi. - <a href="https://www.qut.edu.au/study/unit?unitCode=IFB102"> Click for further details about this Unit</a>

    <td> IFB103 - IT Systems Design </td>
    <td> 
      <blockquote>
        Developing an innovative, practical and cost-effective IT solution that is user-focused is a complex task for IT experts. It requires a systematic
        process that includes: 1) identifying and clarifying a business problem that an IT system can help to resolve; 2) collecting and interpreting
        requirements; 3) decomposing the system into its components; and, 4) prototyping techniques to ensure that all the components of the system satisfy
        the requirements. This unit presents students with authentic industry challenges in which you apply your IT knowledge, fundamental analysis and
        design techniques. It exposes you to design contexts, theories, processes, principles and methods that IT experts use, either individually or in a
        group, to analyse and design an IT system. The unit builds your skills towards any career related to operational analysis and design of a specific
        business scope, including Business Systems Analyst, Solution Architect, and Project Manager. - <a href="https://www.qut.edu.au/study/unit?unitCode=IFB103"> Click for further details about this Unit</a>

    <td> IFB104 - Building IT Systems </td>
    <td>
      <blockquote>
        This unit provides a hands-on introduction to computer programming for students with no prior coding experience at all. It introduces the basic
        principles of programming in a typical imperative language, including expressions, assignment, functions, choice and iteration. It then shows how
        to use Application Programming Interfaces to complete common Information Technology tasks such as querying databases, creating user interfaces, and
        searching for patterns in large datasets. The emphasis is on developing skills through practice, so the unit includes numerous coding exercises and
        assignments, using a simple scripting language and code development environment. The unit establishes a foundation for later subjects that teach
        large-scale software development using industrial-strength programming languages - <a href="https://www.qut.edu.au/study/unit?unitCode=IFB104">

    <td> IFb105 - Database Mangement </td>
    <td>
      <blockquote>
        This is an introductory unit on database addressing the core concepts, requirements and practices of databases. It introduces conceptual data
        modeling to address a key area of concern of modeling structured data to build a comprehensive understanding of the data aspect of a problem. You
        will learn how to transform such data model into a relational database design as well as how to effectively retrieve data through SQL queries.
        Normalization, database security/administration, other special topics and ethical aspects related to information systems are also covered. - <a
