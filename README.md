    <td> 
      <blockquote>
        This unit presents students with authentic industry challenges in which you apply your IT knowledge, fundamental analysis and
        design techniques. It exposes you to design contexts, theories, processes, principles and methods that IT experts use, either individually or in a
        group, to analyse and design an IT system. The unit builds your skills towards any career related to operational analysis and design of a specific
        business scope, including Business Systems Analyst, Solution Architect, and Project Manager. - <a href="https://www.qut.edu.au/study/unit?unitCode=IFB103"> Click for further details about this Unit</a>

    <td> IFB104 - Building IT Systems </td>
    <td>
      <blockquote>
        This unit provides a hands-on introduction to computer programming for students with no prior coding experience at all. It introduces the basic
        principles of programming in a typical imperative language, including expressions, assignment, functions, choice and iteration. It then shows how
        to use Application Programming Interfaces to complete common Information Technology tasks such as querying databases, creating user interfaces, and
        searching for patterns in large datasets.  - <a href="https://www.qut.edu.au/study/unit?unitCode=IFB104">

      <blockquote>
        This is an introductory unit on database addressing the core concepts, requirements and practices of databases. It introduces conceptual data
        modeling to address a key area of concern of modeling structured data to build a comprehensive understanding of the data aspect of a problem. You
        will learn how to transform such data model into a relational database design as well as how to effectively retrieve data through SQL queries.
        Normalization, database security/administration, other special topics and ethical aspects related to information systems are also covered. - <a
